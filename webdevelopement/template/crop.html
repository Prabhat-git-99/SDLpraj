        <h3>Crop, In agriculture, a plant or plant product that can be grown and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence. 
        By use, crops fall into six categories: food crops, for human consumption (e.g., wheat, potatoes);
        feed crops, for livestock consumption (e.g., oats, alfalfa); fibre crops, for cordage and textiles (e.g., cotton, hemp); 
         oil crops, for consumption or industrial uses (e.g., cottonseed, corn); 
         ornamental crops, for landscape gardening (e.g., dogwood, azalea); and industrial and secondary crops, 
         for various personal and industrial uses (e.g., rubber, tobacco).
